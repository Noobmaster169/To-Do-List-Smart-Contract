# To-Do-List-Smart-Contract #
Simple smart contract to keep track of user's tasks

**How it works:**
- Users could use the Smart Contract to assign a person to finish a task before the deadline
- To add/update a task, users need to pay a fee of 0.001 ETH
- Assigned members could use the smart contract to check their current existing tasks
- Assigned members could finish the task as long as the deadline hasn't passed
- Task Assignee could refresh/update a task deadline
- Owner (Contract Creator) could withdraw the manager fee paid by the users
